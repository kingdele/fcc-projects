 <p>No matter how far ahead in life you are, 
    it’s foolish to think that the world revolves around you. 
    No matter how much power you gain, some things just cannot be changed, death being one of them.
     It will eventually come for you and at that time, all the riches, wealth and power that you acquired will mean nothing.</p>
