              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
              It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
              (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
              objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
              them.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                  Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                  objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                  For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                  elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                  clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                  objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                  server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                  database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                  another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                  server.

                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
                and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

              To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
              your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
              <code
                >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
              </code>
    
              Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
              browser!

            <p>
              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
              The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <article>
              You can declare a variable in three ways:
              <p>
                With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
                syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
              </p>
            </article>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <article>
              <p>
                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
                is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                function.
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                
                <code
                >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                not defined</code>

            <article>
              <p>
                Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                variables using the window.variable syntax.

            <article>
              <p>
                You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
                The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
                and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.

            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
              <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                    <li>
                      null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                      JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                      NULL, or any other variant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                    </li>
                    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                    <li>
                      Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                      are unique and immutable.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
    
                <li>and Object</li>
              </ul>
              Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
              you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
              functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
              think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
              procedures that your application can perform.

            <header>if...else statement</header>
            <article>
              Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
              true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
              condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
    
              <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
              condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
              Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
              condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
              statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
              statement, including further nested if statements.
              <p>
                You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
              </p>
              <code
                >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
                statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
                statement_last; }

          <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
            <header>while statement</header>
            <article>
              A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
              condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
    
              <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
              false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
              the statement following the loop.
    
              <p>
                The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
                If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
                condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>

            <article>
              A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
              statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
    
              <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>
                  A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                  separated by commas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
